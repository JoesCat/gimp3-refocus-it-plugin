  * Replaced deprecated INTLTOOL with GETTEXT
  * Updated configure.ac and Makefile.am from 2.54 to 2.69
  * Removed xmalloc code - We should avoid doing exit() here.
  * Simplified a lot of code with expectation of upgrading to GIMP3.
  * Inline is interesting, but the speed gains in excluding a call
    and matching return are neglible. Opted for smaller exe instead.
  * Optional float/double simplified to double since GIMP3 uses double.
  * Dropped build of cmd-line tools, since GIMP3 will use GTK3.
  * GIMP2 plugin binary name simplified to refocus-it
  * po/* locale files renamed to use gimp20-refocus-it
  * Dropped micro_version value since this is a binary, not a library.
    Distros can opt to use the micro_version value for their builds.
  * Realigned all code in src/* directory since some code followed
    different styles (TABs, spaces, {brackets}. Chose to use a more
    compact coding style similar to Fontforge 20120731 which allows
    more code to be viewed per display screen.
  * Dropped help/ directory, appeared unfinished and preliminary.
  * Moved doc/*.pgm to img/ directory since these are useful 16bpp.
  * Imported sourceforge information page into README.md and img/*.jpg

  NOTE: This is still a GIMP2 binary, and builds okay on gimp-2.10
