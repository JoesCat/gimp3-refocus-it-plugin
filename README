The Iterative refocus Gimp-2.0 plug-in can be used to sharpen images acquired
by a defocused camera, blurred with gaussian or motion blur or any combination
of these degradations. In cases of severe blur it produces much better
results than plug-ins such as sharpen or unsharp mask.

There are a few nice features of this plug-in, especially adaptive/static area
smoothing used to remove the so called "ringing" effect introduced by edges in
the image and effects introduced by noise. Two boundary conditions can be used
(mirror boundaries / periodical boundaries). The algorithm is based on finding
the minimum of the error function using Hopfield neural network.
There are a few NOT nice features of this plug-in as well, namely its memory
and CPU requirements.

This plug-in has a preview that helps you select the best parameters.

This version of the plug-in needs the Gtk+-2.2.2 libraries or newer.
